# NgRx Examples

> Example Angular CLI project with various usages of NgRx

## Why?

A lot of examples for Redux (in general) and NgRx (specifically) are one or more of:

- Using outdated patterns/APIs
- A bit simple
- A bit contrived

This project aims to build up a library of somewhat realistic example usages with varying levels of complexity.

## What's here so far?

The app is an Angular CLI app using the router, and Material components. It has a route and a feature state for each example usage. The examples are:

- **Todos** - a todo list with an editable title; uses actions and reducers
- **Blog** - a blog editor where you can add new posts and edit existing ones; uses actions, reducers and effects

## Next up?

- **Tree** - an editor for a hierarchical tree of objects (more complex!)
- unit tests (still figuring these out)

## Try it locally

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You should be up on port 4200 quickly enough.
